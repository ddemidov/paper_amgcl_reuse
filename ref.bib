abstract = {The objective of this work is to describe the design and implementation of a framework for building multi-disciplinary finite element programs. The main goals are generality, reusability, extendibility, good performance and memory efficiency. Another objective is preparing the code structure for team development to ensure the easy collaboration of experts in different fields in the development of multi-disciplinary applications. Kratos, the framework described in this work, contains several tools for the easy implementation of finite element applications and also provides a common platform for the natural interaction of different applications. To achieve this, an innovative variable base interface is designed and implemented. This interface is used at different levels of abstraction and showed to be very clear and extendible. A very efficient and flexible data structure and an extensible IO are created to overcome difficulties in dealing with multi-disciplinary problems. Several other concepts in existing works are also collected and adapted to coupled problems. The use of an interpreter, of different data layouts and variable number of dofs per node are examples of such approach. In order to minimize the possible conflicts arising in the development, a kernel and application approach is used. The code is structured in layers to reflect the working space of developers with different fields of expertise. Details are given on the approach chosen to increase performance and efficiency. Examples of application of Kratos to different multidisciplinary problems are presented in order to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the new object oriented environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.},

@article{Dadvand2013,
abstract = {Creating a highly parallelizable code is a challenge specially for Distributed Memory Machines (DMMs). Moreover, algorithms and data structures suitable for these platforms can be very different from the ones used in serial code. For this reason, many programmers in the field prefer to start their own code from scratch. However, for an already existing framework supported by a long-time expertise the idea of transformation becomes attractive in order to reuse the effort done during years of development. In this presentation we explain how a relatively complex framework but with modular structure can be prepared for high performance computing with minimum modification. Kratos Multi-Physics [1] is an open source generic multi-disciplinary platform for solution of coupled problems consist of fluid, structure, thermal and electromagnetic fields. The parallelization of this framework is performed with objective of enforcing the less possible changes to its different solver modules and encapsulate the changes as much as possible in its common kernel. This objective is achieved thanks to the Kratos design and also innovative way of dealing with data transfers for a multi-disciplinary code. This work is completed by the migration of the framework from the 86× architecture to the Marenostrum Supercomputing platform. The migration has been verified by a set of benchmarks which show high scalability, from which we present the Telescope problem in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
